In this article, we will learn how to deploy React Native apps to the Android Play Store automatically using [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

Our goal is to use specific release tracks on Play Store to give us a fast and reliable environment to test and iterate on our app, be it on the internal tracking branch or the open beta one, before sending the release to production and making it available on the Play Store.

Each of the three release tracks we are going to use is going to match one of the branches on our repository:

Alpha Track -> develop Branch
Beta Track -> staging Branch
Production Track -> master branch
