In this article, we will learn how to deploy React Native apps to the Android Play Store automatically using [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

Our goal is to use specific release tracks on Play Store to give us a fast and reliable environment to test and iterate on our app, be it on the internal tracking branch or the open beta one, before sending the release to production and making it available on the Play Store.

This is a inline code `echo "Hello World"`

This is a highlighted inline code: `js|>console.log("lol")`

This is a highlighted codeblock with line numbers:

```typescript{numberLines: true}
import React from 'react'

import { Text } from 'rebass'

export const ListItem = (props) => {
  return <Text variant="body" as="li" {...props} />
}
```

This is a highlighted codeblock with line highlights:

```typescript
import React from 'react'

// highlight-start
import { Text } from 'rebass'
// highlight-end

export const ListItem = (props) => {
  return <Text variant="body" as="li" {...props} />
}
```

This is a highlighted codeblock with both line numbers and line highlights:

```typescript{numberLines: true}
import React from 'react'

// highlight-start
import { Text } from 'rebass'
// highlight-end

export const ListItem = (props) => {
  return <Text variant="body" as="li" {...props} />
}
```

This is a highlighted codeblock with some lines hidden:

```typescript
import React from 'react'

import { Text } from 'rebass'

// hide-next-line
import { Something } from 'something'

export const ListItem = (props) => {
  return <Text variant="body" as="li" {...props} />
}
```

This is a highlighted codeblock with a file title:

```js:title=example-file.js
console.log('lol')
```

This is a highlighted codeblock for an embed file:

`embed:code-example/sample-code.tsx`

This is a shell prompt:

```bash {promptUser: jcm}{prompHost: dev.localhost}{outputLines: 2}
echo "stuff" | grep stuff
stuff
```
