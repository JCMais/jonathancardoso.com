Esta poderia ser uma versão traduzida do conteúdo original, mas como eu não pretendo gastar tempo traduzindo um post de testes, apenas este paragráfo introdutório está traduzido. Segue o conteúdo original:

In this article, we will learn how to deploy React Native apps to the Android Play Store automatically using [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

Our goal is to use specific release tracks on Play Store to give us a fast and reliable environment to test and iterate on our app, be it on the internal tracking branch or the open beta one, before sending the release to production and making it available on the Play Store.

Each of the three release tracks we are going to use is going to match one of the branches on our repository:

## Heading 2

This is some text right below a section, spacing should be cool here, and not be too bigger or too small.

### Heading 3

This is some text right below a section, spacing should be cool here, and not be too bigger or too small.

#### Heading 4

This is some text right below a section, spacing should be cool here, and not be too bigger or too small.

This is a **strong**, then a _emphasized_ text.

<p style="text-align: center">This is a center aligned text</p>

Now some quoted text:

> Line 1 - Something something something something something something something something something something  
> Line 2 - Something something something something something something something something something something  
> Line 3 - Something something something something something something something something something something  
> Line 4 - Something something something something something something something something something something
>
> > Line 4.1 - Something something something something something something something something something something

_<p style="text-align: right">We could use right aligned text to give the source</p>_

Some JSX Code running directly from Markdown (🧡 mdx):

import { SampleButton } from './code-example/sample-code'

<SampleButton />

This is a footnote[^1].

This is a topic list:

- Topic A
- Topic B
- Topic C

This is a numbered list:

1. This is a numbered list
1. there it goes
1. so on...  
    asda
   - It can be nested
   - Like this.

This is a table:

| column1 | column2 | column3 |
| :------ | :-----: | ------: |
| r1col1  | r1col2  |  r1col3 |
| r2col1  | r2col2  |  r2col3 |
| r3col1  | r3col2  |  r3col3 |
| r4col1  | r4col2  |  r4col3 |

    This is a pre
      formatted text.
        It will appear exactly like typed.

This is a inline code `echo "Hello World"`

This is a highlighted inline code: `js|>console.log("lol")`

This is a highlighted codeblock with line numbers:

```typescript{numberLines: true}
import React from 'react'

import { Text } from 'rebass'

export const ListItem = (props) => {
  return <Text variant="body" as="li" {...props} />
}
```

This is a highlighted codeblock with line highlights:

```typescript
import React from 'react'

// highlight-start
import { Text } from 'rebass'
// highlight-end

export const ListItem = (props) => {
  return <Text variant="body" as="li" {...props} />
}
```

This is a highlighted codeblock with both line numbers and line highlights:

```typescript{numberLines: true}
import React from 'react'

// highlight-start
import { Text } from 'rebass'
// highlight-end

export const ListItem = (props) => {
  return <Text variant="body" as="li" {...props} />
}
```

This is a highlighted codeblock with some lines hidden:

```typescript
import React from 'react'

import { Text } from 'rebass'

// hide-next-line
import { Something } from 'something'

export const ListItem = (props) => {
  return <Text variant="body" as="li" {...props} />
}
```

This is a highlighted codeblock with a file title:

```js:title=example-file.js
console.log('lol')
```

This is a highlighted codeblock for an embed file:  
`embed:code-example/sample-code.tsx`

This is a shell prompt:

```bash {promptUser: jcm}{prompHost: dev.localhost}{outputLines: 2}
echo "stuff" | grep stuff
stuff
```
